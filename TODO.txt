[✓] Zobrist hash
[✓] Don't keep the "table" in state - there's only one State object now, other "states" are stored as a ulong zHash
[✓] More efficient GeneratePlayerReachable (flood-fill) - tried a scanline method, the simple 4-way with a Stack is still fast enough
[✓] Deadlock detection
[?] Choosing next state based on Heuristic distance (A*)
